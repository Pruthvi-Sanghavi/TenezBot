## Overview

We propose to design "TenezBot" a tennis ball collecting robot, by incorporating high-quality software engineering practices for Acme Robotics. "TenezBot" package is a complete software package which will be integrated in their new line of products. Tennis is played widely throughout the world. Mastering this game requires a good amount of time. But with that comes the demanding task of collecting hundreds of tennis balls scattered across the court, which becomes really frustrating after a tiring practice session. Thus we are aiming to develop “TenezBot” a robot which can detect ball, its position in the environment, reach out to the ball and collect it in a sac using a custom made collector attached with the TurtleBot base platform. The robot would use vision camera for vision and depth measurement. Path planning algorithms are used to reach out to the balls so that the task performance is optimum.

## Package Deliverables

This software package contains:

1. Code Files
2. Dependent Software Packages
3. World file: 
	1. Tennis Court World
	2. Empty World
4. Demo files:
	1. Bag file (Showing the simulation of robot collecting balls in the court)
	2. Visualization tools
	3. RQT Graphs
5.  Instruction manual
	- Building, Running, Tesing, Recording and Playing Instruction.
	- Hardware Implementation Instructions.

## Approach

The robot would perform the following steps to complete its task
- Sense the environment and use computer vision to detect the ball.
- Calculate the distance to the nearest Ball.
- Plan the path from the current position to the ball position coordinate.
- Reach the ball coordinate and collect the ball in sac.
- Calculate the distance to the other nearest Ball.

```
To check whether OpenCV is alive and kicking, type as given below.
```
python
import cv2
print(cv2.__version__)
``` After the version gets printed, exit the python command line by typing ```
exit()
```

## ROS Dependencies
CV_Bridge

## Creating Workspace and Package

Create a ROS Workspace by running the following commands. (Replace <workspace> with the workspace name of your liking.)

- Open a terminal
```
mkdir -p ~/<workspace>/src
cd <workspace>
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
``` 
For creating the TenezBot Package, Run the following commands. 
```
cd src
git clone https://github.com/Pruthvi-Sanghavi/TenezBot
cd ..
catkin_make
```

## Running the Demo

To run the demo, run the following commands in the terminal.

- Open a terminal

```
cd <workspace>
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch tenezbot tenezbot.launch
```

## Bag file

If cppcheck package is not installed, then to install the package, run the following command:
```
sudo apt-get install cppcheck
```
To run cppcheck in Terminal, run the following commands:
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/object_collection_robotic_arm/
cppcheck --std=c++11 -I include/ --suppress=missingIncludeSystem $(find . -name \*.cpp -or -name \*.hpp | grep -vE -e "^./docs/" -e "^./launch/" -e "^./results/" -e "^./UML/" -e "./world/")
```

```


## Generating Doxygen Documentation

To install doxygen run the following command:
```
sudo apt install doxygen
```
<!-- 
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/object_collection_robotic_arm/
mkdir docs
doxygen -g config
```
Open the Doxygen configuration file "config" and update the following parameters:

* PROJECT_NAME = "object_collection_robotic_arm"

* INPUT = ./src ./include/ ./test

* OUTPUT_DIRECTORY = docs

Then, rename the "config" file to "doxconfig".
 -->

Now, to generate doxygen documentation, run the following commands:

```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/TenezBot/
doxygen -g
doxygen doxconfig
```
Doxygen files will be generated to /docs folder. To view them in a browser, run the following commands:

```
cd docs/html
firefox index.html
```
## Known Issues/Bugs

- Ball color is fixed.
- Ball collection requires a speacial mechanism. It can be demonstrated by making the balls to disappear using ros service.
- Robot has a limited depth and vision.
